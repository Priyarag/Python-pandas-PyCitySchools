    "1. Looking by overall passing rate, \"Charter\" schools tops the best performing list with all the 8 schools in the top 8. \n",
    "2. School with student size more than 2500 , appears to be underperforming with a passing rate of about 74% only which is majorly due to % Passing Math is about 67% only.\n",
    "3. Though Total Budget or Avg Per Student Budget is higher in District, Charter's passing rate is higher than District's.\n",
    "4. Futher analysis or more information on data is needed to understand the performance better , for example: does district schools have higher student to less number of teachers or less infrasturcture facilities like labs.\n"
